textemplate
===========

This is a LaTeX document template.  Instead of creating documents from scratch,
this template can be used as a starting point.  It makes significant use of
shorthand macros.  Features:

* modular Makefile with
  [implicit rules for compiling LaTeX](mk/tex.mk) and
  [implicit rules for compiling several image formats](mk/imagerules.mk);
* a [paper template](paper.tex);
* a [talk/seminar template](talk.tex);
* a [few custom sty files](sty/)
